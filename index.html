        <h1>The thing is I don't have a Home</h1>
        <small>Dreams are not just for seeing.
          They are for realizing, and when you believe in them, they become reality.</small>
        <p>My dream is simple, yet bright,
          A home and a dog by my side, as a friend,
          To feel the warmth of familiar walls,
          And run together in the morning’s light.

          My dream is not in luxury or great fame,
          But in having a place for the soul,
          Where each morning begins with joyful steps,
          And the dog runs after me, loyal and brave.

          A dream home is not just a house, but a space for dreams,
          Where, together as a family, we can be alive,
          And the dog is a friend, always by my side,
          Loyal, kind.</p>

        <h3>My Dream Dog</h3>
        <img src="./photo/dog.jpg" alt="dog-my" />
        <p>True friends are not always people.
          Sometimes they can be those we least expect to see — animals that offer us unconditional love and support.
           We all seek support and understanding, but sometimes it is animals that become our greatest friends,
           who will never betray, deceive, and will always be by our side.
            They can sense our emotions and help us without words, simply through their presence. </p>
